<h1>AI-DRIVEN VOICE ASSISTANT</h1>
<p>
Veena is a multilingual voice-based insurance assistant bot built using Python. It interacts 
with users to guide them through life insurance policy renewal conversations. The bot 
supports English, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati languages and dynamically switches between 
them based on user input. It uses structured conversation branches to explain policy details, 
handle objections with pre-defined rebuttals, and record user intentions. 
It also integrates Wikipedia to answer general insurance-related queries in the selected 
language. The bot features a GUI chat window, speech recognition using the Google Speech 
API, and voice output using gTTS and Pygame. </p>
