<h1>AI-DRIVEN VOICE ASSISTANT</h1>
<p>
Veena is an AI-powered, multilingual insurance assistant bot built using Python and large language models (LLMs). It interacts with users through both voice calls and a GUI chat interface to guide them through life insurance policy renewal conversations. The bot intelligently answers questions, handles objections, and provides contextual recommendations in real time. It supports English, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati, dynamically switching languages based on user input. Wikipedia integration allows Veena to answer general insurance-related queries. Twilio enables real-time voice calls, allowing Veena to communicate seamlessly over the phone. </p>
